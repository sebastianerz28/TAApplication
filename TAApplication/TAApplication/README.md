# Overview of the TA Application Functionality 

The TA Application program is currently capable of taking applicants' applications and storing them in a database a long with taking file uploads of resumes and profile pictures as well as creating, displaying, courses.
Along with taking applications a interactive way of displaying and editting the applicants availability was added. An interactive Pixi application is used to update a TA's availability. The admin can
Now view enrollement trends using a highchart display.
The most recent work was adding an Enrollment Trends page where a highchart is used to display enrollement data for courses.

# Comments to Evaluators:

We decided to only display up to the point where there is data. Our chart won't display past the date that there is no data even if asked for. We also decided to keep the data that was asked for
and its exact dates even when start date is changed so another query does not have to be used.

# Improvements:

We use date inputs instead of a text input to grab the start and end dates.

# Above and Beyond

For our above and beyond we implemented a dark mode for the web page as well as uploaded our website to AWS.

# Consulted Peers:

We did not speak to any peers other than the TA's because we did not need the help

# Peers Helped:

None, No one asked for help
