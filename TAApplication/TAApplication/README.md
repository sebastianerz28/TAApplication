# Overview of the TA Application Functionality 

The TA Application program is currently capable of taking applicants' applications and storing them in a database a long with taking file uploads of resumes and profile pictures as well as creating, displaying, courses. 
The most recent work was adding the courses table in the database along with updating the scaffolded views.

-For the editing the note on the courses table. We chose to make the notes a link which will show a popup that then edits the note. We chose the link option to show the user thank this is a clickable part of the page.
