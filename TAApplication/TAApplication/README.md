# Overview of the TA Application Functionality 

The TA Application program is currently capable of taking applicants' applications and storing them in a database a long with taking file uploads of resumes and profile pictures as well as creating, displaying, courses.
Along with taking applications a interactive way of displaying and setting the applicants availability was added.
The most recent work was adding a PIXI interface for interactively updating an applicant's availability.

# Comments to Evaluators:

We decided on the save button which was the easiest way to show if it is saved or not.

# Improvements:

Updated save button to be only be able to be clicked when needed to be saved.
