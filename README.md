# Overview of the TA Application Functionality 

The TA Application program is currently capable of registering and loggin in users with roles and authorization The most recent work was adding user functionality as well as dynamically presenting information
on the website.

# Comments to Evaluators:

# Observations on Authentication and Authorization:

We have found that authorization and authentication is definitely made easier with the scafolded default project. We also have found how powerful combining roles and CSHTML into webpages can really be. Allowing certain
people to see and use certain things creates a personalized experience which is much more intriguing to users. In this assignment we were able to show and hide things based upon the users authorization level such as an
Admin having the ability to change peoples' roles.

# Above and Beyond:

In our assignment we added another drop down on the right nav bar to add the logout and account information placeholder. This just feels natural on websites so we felt is was needed on this website. We
also added an extra apply button on the homepage because having multiple links and ways to get to the main application helps it become more user friendly. We also added the feature that the TA dropdown isnt 
shown to non-logged in users.
